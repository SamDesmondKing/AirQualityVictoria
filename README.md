# AirQualityVictoria

Twitter bot designed to post updates on air quality in Victoria directly 
from the Victorian EPA. Can be used as a 'daily weather check' for 
people suffering respiratory conditions as a result of busfire smoke and 
pollution in Victoria.

Please note this is a work in progress and isn't automated yet so bot 
may be out of date at present.

You can find the bot here: twitter.com/airqualityvic
